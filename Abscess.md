**2025 July 15th Injury/Illness**  Kanji most likely got a tooth puncture in her head from a sick dog. Kanji was throwing up and not her usual self on July 16th. She was back to her normal self on July 17th, but she cried if you touched her head in the wrong way. On July 18th, she developed a edema-like swelling on her head. This broke open in the late afternoon of the 18th. There was a pink exudate, that had an odour, but was not foul smelling.

The top of Kanji's head continued to scab over, and then it would fill with liquid. It would either break open on its own, or it would break when I bathed her head each morning and evening. 

I put on chlorhexidine from a swab. On Monday I bought some Betadine, and mixed it 10:1 with sterile saline, and then applied it with a 10ml syringe morning and evening.

There was a lot of exudate on the evening of July 21st. On the afternoon of July 22nd was the last time the scab broke and it drained. Below is a photo of the scab on July 24th.

July 26th: I washed the dogs hair in the morning, and hair fell out from the area that had swollen up. I noticed the area starting to fill with liquid again, albeit more slowly on the night of the 25th. On the night of the 26th, the area was swollen again.

The area was painted with Betadine, and then punctured with a 18g needle. The fluid that drained was dark red congealed blood. This is what the area looked like the next morning of the 27th:
